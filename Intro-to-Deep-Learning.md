# Intro to Deep Learning
======================

### Interpreting weights in a neural network
* We say a neuron has "learned" an image if it fires on that image.
* In this way, it can only tell you which vectors are important, and not which features.

### One Hot Encoding
* Changes categorical(integer) data into a indication vector
* Number of labels= Number of dimensions
* Done to eliminate "closeness bias" that comes with real numbers.
