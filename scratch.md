## How Linear Regression differs from Classification
* Although we can think of Classification as drawing a line in between the data set, an alternativs visualization would be to view the output as the stitching of two planes. 
* In this way, we can see why classification is not a special case of regression, despite the fact that 1 and 0 are real numbers! 
	* Regression only produces one plane
