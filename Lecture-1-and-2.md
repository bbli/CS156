* **Machine Learning will do whatever it takes to agree with experiment. Thus, machine learning is solely reliant on experiment, and not theory, to provide a model.**

## Formulating the Learning Problem

* Scientist decides the **Hypothesis Set**and **Learning Algorithm**

## Feasibility of Learning
The Learning Problem is basically the following question:

> What can we learn from a finite sample of a large set? Can we trust our models to predict outside the training data?


*  **Mapping to Bins**
We want to map to bins so we can make a probability statement.

* To be fully rigorous, we now need to say the training data was generated by a probability distrubution.
