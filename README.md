The advantage of using Git is that with the Magit plugin installed in vim, I could review and revise my notes until I thought my understanding of ther material was solid enough to "commit". Furthermore, I can review in "uncommited" notes in chunks, which provides a way or organizing my uncertainty of the subject at hand.

Furthermore, I have used git's branching and merging abilities as a way to track the questions I had while learning and my resolution to them. In this manner I hoped to create a more "nonlinear" flow to my notes. To visualize this branching business, I used the following alias in my gitconfig:
```
lol = log --graph --oneline --decorate --pretty=format:\"%C(yellow)%h%Creset%C(red)%C(bold)%d%Creset %C(cyan)(%cr)%Creset %s\"
```
